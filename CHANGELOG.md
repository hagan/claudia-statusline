## [2.8.1] - 2025-08-30

### Critical Bug Fix & Phase 2 Database Maintenance

#### Fixed
- **SQLite UPSERT Bug**: Fixed critical bug where session costs were being accumulated instead of replaced
  - The UPSERT operation was incorrectly using `cost = cost + ?` instead of `cost = ?`
  - This caused costs to grow exponentially with each update
  - Also affected lines_added and lines_removed fields
- **Delta Calculations**: Properly implemented delta tracking for daily/monthly stats
  - Now correctly calculates the difference between old and new values
  - Prevents double-counting when sessions are updated
  - Daily and monthly aggregates remain accurate

#### Added - Phase 2 Database Maintenance (COMPLETE)
- **Database Maintenance Command**: New `statusline db-maintain` subcommand
  - `--force-vacuum`: Force VACUUM even if not needed (normally runs when DB > 10MB or > 7 days since last vacuum)
  - `--no-prune`: Skip data retention pruning
  - `--quiet`: Run in quiet mode (errors only)
  - Performs WAL checkpoint (TRUNCATE mode)
  - Runs PRAGMA optimize for query planner
  - Conditional VACUUM based on size/time thresholds
  - Data pruning based on retention configuration
  - Integrity check with proper exit codes (exit 1 on failure)
- **Automated Maintenance**: Shell script wrapper at `scripts/maintenance.sh`
  - Supports cron integration with proper exit codes
  - `--log FILE` option for logging output
  - Exit codes: 0=success, 1=integrity failure, 2=other error
- **Data Retention Configuration**: In config.toml
  - `database.retention_days_sessions`: Keep sessions for N days (default: 90)
  - `database.retention_days_daily`: Keep daily stats for N days (default: 365)
  - `database.retention_days_monthly`: Keep monthly stats for N days (0 = forever)
- **Meta Table**: Tracks maintenance state (last_vacuum timestamp)
- **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive tests for bug fix
  - Fixed `test_session_update` to expect replacement behavior
  - Added `test_session_update_delta_calculation` for delta verification
  - Tests prevent regression of the accumulation bug

#### Migration Notes
- Users with corrupted SQLite data should delete and rebuild: `rm ~/.local/share/claudia-statusline/stats.db`
- The statusline will automatically rebuild from JSON on next run
- Or use `statusline migrate --finalize --delete-json` to accept current state
- Set up automated maintenance with cron: `0 3 * * 0 /path/to/maintenance.sh`

## [2.8.0] - 2025-08-30
